"""
Assemble the full espcontrol tree with community device overlays.

Builds a throwaway working tree at .assembly/ by:
1. Cloning upstream espcontrol at the pinned ref
2. Copying community device overlays into the tree
3. Merging the community catalog fragment into upstream's device catalog
4. Running upstream generators (manifest, slots, build devices)
5. Running upstream validators (manifest, matrix, profiles)
6. Building the web bundle (npm ci + build.py www)
7. Copying the bundle to community-pages/webserver/www.js

Usage:
    python3 community/scripts/assemble.py [--skip-checks] [--skip-web] [--sync-generated] [--strict] [--self-test]
    python3 community/scripts/assemble.py --self-test-offline

--strict makes a non-zero exit from an upstream generator fail the run.
Upstream's generators own the content between the BEGIN/END GENERATED
markers; when one of them dies, the device keeps its previous blocks and
every check still passes, so a compile against it proves nothing about the
new ref. The ref-bump workflow runs with --strict for that reason.
